1 - Run the "Dataviz_project" file, which will download the data from the API, 
extract the information and produce two datasets as output. 
These will be saved in the same folder as the runned file, 
and on which our work will be based. 

2 - Run the "app.py" file to let the code run

3 - Once runned the "app.py" open the link of the website and you will be able 
to see our page (We suggest to use Google Chrome when running the dash)

4- Once done all of this, while the app.py is still running, you can access to our web site using this link: https://fmiglioreig.wixsite.com/data-vis-project
