Welcome to the Yu-Gi-Oh! Deck Builder repository! In this project, my team and I have developed a dashboard that allows you to create your own personal deck based on your preferred monster card attributes. Using a dataset containing a large number of Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, complete with descriptions and technical characteristics, we have implemented an interactive platform to assist you in constructing your ideal deck.

**Features**

*Attribute-based Deck Creation*: Our dashboard enables you to select your preferred monster card attribute, such as Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Light, or Dark. Based on this attribute, the system will recommend magic and trap cards that synergize well with your chosen attribute.

*Cost Optimization*: We understand the importance of budget management while building a deck. Our platform allows you to set the cost for each card, helping you maximize the power of your deck while minimizing expenses.

*Interactive Experience*: Our intuitive user interface provides a seamless and interactive experience. You can easily navigate through the available cards, filter them based on various criteria, and visualize the composition of your deck.

**Getting Started**

1 - Run the "Dataviz_project" file, which will download the data from the API, 
extract the information and produce two datasets as output. 
These will be saved in the same folder as the runned file, 
and on which our work will be based. 

2 - Run the "app.py" file to let the code run

3 - Once runned the "app.py" open the link of the website and you will be able 
to see our page (We suggest to use Google Chrome when running the dash)

4- Once done all of this, while the app.py is still running, you can access to our web site using this link: https://fmiglioreig.wixsite.com/data-vis-project
